# PassionTest
This is a Coding Challenge Task for Front-end Development Job at Passion.io (work from home).
(Includes React.js, Redux, Redux-thunk, SASS to CSS and HTML)

Steps to Check the Test :-

1) First install all the dependencies using `npm install or npm i `
2) Then Configure .env file for Google API (If You want to Integrate your Client API-KEY) and LOCAL_API_URL for Fetching JSON File.
3) To Run the Development Mode use `npm run dev` command.
4) To Make the Production Buidl use `npm run build` command.
5) Then to API Express Server use `npm start` or `node server`
6) Open the Browser usign `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:3000/api/:id` to access the API for Categories, Courses and Verticals JSON files.  NOTE:- Here `:id` is a url route parameter. 

How Does Solution Scale ?
Solution can be Scaled by managing more Async Tasks while performing Fetching the List Data, Right now Everything is on local Server but in Real Life Server Will take some time to process it based on network connectivity or server hardware that we need to manage that async task to Optimise the View Model of Project.

What would you improve next?
Right Now, I haven't mock up design or any design reference to make the UI. If any UI/UX Developer provide me the design then based on that i will make my own Class or Component Level Model to Develop the Efficient Front-End using React.js and Redux.
